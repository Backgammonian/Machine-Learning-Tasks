# Ensembles for classification & regression tasks
The goal of this project is to learn how to use a powerful machine learning methods called ensembles.

The ensemble algorithms are provided by Scikit-learn, CatBoost & XGBoost packages.\
The performance of ensembles is showcased using synthetic datasets.\
Their performance is compared against "classic" ML algorithms (KNN, linear and logistic regression, etc.) and also against relatively simple neural network.
