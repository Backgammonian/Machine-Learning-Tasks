# Random Russian quotes generation (Keras)
This is an educational project of natural language generation.
The text dataset is composed of quotes parsed from (citaty.info)[https://citaty.info/] site and (Russian "gang" quotes)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/egoluback/russian-gang-quotes] from Kaggle.

Key steps of the project:
* Multithread Web-parsing of quotes in order to collect them in a single file
* Text data preprocessing and vectorization
* Building and testing of LSTM-based neural network for generating natural language based on specified input sentence
