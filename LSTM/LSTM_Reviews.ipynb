      "Review: want to see a thrilling action movie, don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through. however, if you want a good laugh, please watch it! i even bought the chuck norris 3dvd collection thanks to my enjoyable saturday night. what especially struck me is that évery scene that would be expensive to make was copy-pasted from a discovery documentary or an old tv-special on the us army. furthermore i was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real. afghanistan is, as far as i can remember, nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click deke escapes from the terrorists sand-castle with his jet-pack and is taken away by a submarine (probably discovery). later on in the movie, deke throws an islam terrorist against the wall. in the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall. gotta love it. i recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though, only then you'll understand why i've been mad enough to spend 6,99 euro's on the box.;\n",

      "Review: this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch, and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people. this is your typical lynch short. a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. the blonde has been crying, the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde, and that's about it. with a lot of silent moments, but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti, there is a strange form of suspense. this short feels a little like 'mulholland dr.', a movie i loved, and therefore i liked this one as well. it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this.;\n",

      "Review: i admire deepa mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. i'd recommend to buy this movie on dvd because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once. and trust me, you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times. the characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced, no black and white. even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters. i think the imdb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content.;\n",

      "Review: as though responding to backstage cues. even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. mankiewicz's new york city is a glittering flurry of art deco colour and movement, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal thuggery seems perfectly genial. as i write this review, i've just received word that jean simmons has passed away, age 80. this, unbelievably, was the first time i'd seen her in a film, yet she dazzled me from the beginning. her idealistic and sexually-repressed sarah comes out of her shell following an alcohol binge in havana, letting loose with an adorably playful rendition of \"if i were a bell.\" even though both simmons and brando were non-singers, producer sam goldwyn decided not to dub their vocals, contending that \"maybe you don't sound so good, but at least it's you.\" despite goldwyn's backhanded confidence, the pair both do well to carry entire musical numbers themselves. simmons suggests the same child-like liveliness that audrey hepburn might have brought to the role, and brando exudes such self-assurance and charisma that it doesn't matter that his singing voice isn't quite there.;\n",

      "Review: very funny. ted raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. the plot is wacky, an american business man goes to bulgaria and is killed. stacy keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings bruce campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-kgb turned cabbie. bruce campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the kgb agent. the movie has all the great bruce campbell slap stick and humor. the movie is somewhat predictable, i knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. however i didn't go to see this movie because i thought it would have an oscar winning script, i went to see it because it was a bruce campbell sci-fi movie and i was not disappointed in the least. i highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. although before the movie he said the sci-fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it tv friendly. if you are a fan of bruce, i highly recommend it.;\n",

      "Review: is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. his first movie 'house of games' was the one i liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer. so is 'homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. the principal characters are two cops, one jewish and one irish who deal with a racially charged area. the murder of an old jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the israeli independence war triggers the jewish identity in the mind and heart of the jewish detective. this is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. the process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. the end of the film itself is mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective. joe mantegna and william macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.;\n",

      "Review: well well, at last a view of this underrated flick. but you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. it's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. it is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's. when they enter the sleeping room it's full glory. anyway, banned in the uk since 84 and still on the video nasties list. the reason is simple, it's gory for their time being. it really has some nasty dismemberement's and it's creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way. so every shot the image is moving, things they do these days with the steadycam. the ghastly ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better but still better then other films of the time like schoolgirls in chains.;\n",

      "Review: though i agree \"london\" is better and i prefer that version, too. the first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a \"balloon\" in a restaurant. it also introduces the lead female character, played by julie delpy. i don't see enough of this actress. she doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones i hear about over here in america. this french actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks great. when the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. i also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one: no f-words and no lord's name in vain - amazing! however, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either. this film is geared a lot more toward 20-somethings, if that helps anyone. it's entertaining.....just don't expect it to live up to the first film.;\n",

      "Review: life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. the acting is rather amateurish, at best. the special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. the story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable. for me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell. she may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is cute enough. in all life pod is much like other low-budget sci-fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. the white star lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic (not the sister of titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.;\n",

      "Review: this series would have been a lot better if they had just done one simple thing: made ian mcshane code name: diamond head instead of code name: tree. diamond head the character needs someone who could handle the role of the lovable rogue, which mcshane proved he could do with the lovejoy series. roy thinnes, the actual diamond head, is really only so-so in the role. mcshane is not really that good as the bad guy tree. france nuyen's character, tso-tsing, can't seem to make up her mind as to whether she's the hapless victim or the tough-and-ready-to-fight woman. she really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of diamond head's lover. after viewing an episode or two, i ended up not caring what happened to anyone. tree gives us a lot to hate him, but diamond head gives us nothing to like him. unfortunately, the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960's.;\n",

      "Review: is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery, `cold heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities. there are no striking shots, no edgy effects, no attempts to fit the content to the form. it is workmanlike shooting, but subdued. nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama. it is a simple story that unfolds simply. it may seem odd; but at the end the mystery is revealed. it looks ambiguous; but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of catholic dogma. in this regard, `cold heaven' has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like `the sting,' or `the sixth sense,' or `final descent,' or polanski's `a pure formality.' all of these are films with a trick up their sleeves. they may frustrate you along the way, but they have a point-an obvious one, indeed--but the fun is, at least in part, in having been taken in. still, even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line, it is worth watching for way it directs-and misdirects-you. try it-especially if you are, or have ever been, a catholic.;\n",
