# California housing clustering
The goal of project is to group the houses in California into a prestige groups according to their location, housing age, value and ocean proximity.

Key steps of the project:
* Dataset exploration using charts & statistical indicators
* Dataset preprocessing (standardization, encoding for non-numeric features)
* Comparison of various clustering metrics to find the best amount of clusters for K-Means algorithm (including silhouette score & the elbow rule)
* Comparison of various clustering metrics to find the best `eps` parameter for DBSCAN algorithm

# Youtube channels categories clustering
The task is to group Youtube channels into various categories (music, entertainment, education, etc) according to their uploads, video views and subscribers.

Key steps of this project are mostly the same as above apart from extended set of clustering metrics.

# Self-organizing maps

This project is a showcase of self-organizing Kohonen maps using a relatively simple social networks ads dataset.

An SOM is a special type of artificial neural network trained using competitive learning rather than the error-correction learning (e.g., backpropagation with gradient descent) used by other artificial neural networks.\
The SOM was introduced by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s and therefore is sometimes called a Kohonen map (or Kohonen network).
